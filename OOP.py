# Basic: Create a class called Car with attributes brand and color. Instantiate
#  an object of the Car class and print its attributes.
class Car:

# Intermediate: Add a method called start_engine to the Car 
# class that prints a message saying the engine of the car has 
# started. Create an instance of Car and call the method.

# Advanced: Create a class called BankAccount with attributes account_number and balance. Add methods to:
# Deposit an amount.
# Withdraw an amount (only if sufficient balance exists).
# Print the account balance.

# Challenge: Implement a class called Library that manages a collection of
#  books. Each book has a title, author, and available status. The Library class should have methods to:
# Add a book to the library.
# Remove a book from the library.
# Check if a book is available by title.
# Borrow a book (mark it as unavailable if itâ€™s available).
# Return a book (mark it as available again if it was borrowed).
class Book:
  def __init__(self, title, author,available_status ):
    self.title = title
    self.author = author
    self.available_status = available_status

  def printname(self):
    print(self.title, self.author, self.available_status )

class Library(Book):
  def __init__(self, title, author, available_status, OliverTwist):
    super().__init__(title, author, available_status, OliverTwist)
    self.book = OliverTwist

  def welcome(self):
    print("Welcome to our library with", self.title, self.author,self.available_status, "to the class of", self.OliverTwist)

x = Library("Government Inspector", "Joel", 'yes','OliverTwist')
x.welcome()
